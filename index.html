                    <p align="center"></p> What if the San Francisco Bay Bridge were a canvas for light? That was the seminal question that ultimately sparked a diverse community to action and led to Leo Villareal's creation of the world's largest LED light sculpture. The Largest LED Sculpture The Bay Lights is the world’s largest LED light sculpture, 1.8 miles wide and 500 feet high. Inspired by the Bay Bridge’s 75th Anniversary, artist Leo Villareal creates a never repeating, dazzling display of 25,000 LED white lights through March 2015 across the western span of the Bay Bridge, renamed Willie L. Brown Jr. Bridge in February 2014.</p>
